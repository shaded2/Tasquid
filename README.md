[Tasquid](http://www.tasquid.com/) - Task Management Done Right
================================
Tasquid is a fork of the excellent Astrid project that was bought by Yahoo and shut down. Like Astrid, Tasquid strives to be a simple and effective organization tool for Google Android phones. It comes with features like reminders, tagging, widgets, and integration with online synchronization services.

Interested in using Tasquid? Search "tasquid" in Android Market. Look for the smiling purple squid!
